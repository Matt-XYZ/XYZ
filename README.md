# WWU Dining Tracker
https://dining.mattjones.xyz

This website tracks and displays the dining locations on the WWU campus that are currently open, as well as those opening within the next 2 hours.

This program does not accomodate for unusual closures; it is to be assumed all locations are operating on a normal schedule.

To test the behavior of this program on a certain time and day, append the mode parameter to the URL, set to "debug", as follows:
